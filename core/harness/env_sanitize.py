"""Credential-shaped environment scrubbing for spawned child processes.

Why this is its own module. The harness holds live provider credentials in its
own process environment (``.env`` is loaded by several MCP servers and written
back with ``os.environ.setdefault`` / ``os.environ[k] = v``). Every child we
spawn inherits that environment by default, and any command whose *stdout*
becomes a tool result therefore forwards the value into the next outbound
prompt — where a third-party model relay can read it in plaintext.

That is a passive-collection path, not an exotic one: a single ``env`` call is
enough to close the loop. The cheap, honest mitigation is to not hand the
credentials to children in the first place.

Two rules keep this usable:

* Only credential-*shaped* names are dropped (``KEY`` / ``PASSWORD`` /
  ``SECRET`` / ``TOKEN``). ``PATH``, ``HOME``, locale, and proxy variables
  survive, so children run normally.
* A caller that genuinely needs a variable forwards it explicitly through
  ``extra_env``, which merges *after* the scrub. The scrub is a default, not a
  cage — but forwarding a secret becomes a deliberate act.

Where the scrub applies by default. External agent CLIs
(:mod:`core.harness.agents.external_backend`) have always received the
scrubbed environment and still do. The agent's own shell, hook commands and
the code-mode runtime keep the full environment unless the operator opts in
with ``DEEPCODE_BASH_SCRUB_ENV=1``: everyday work such as ``gh``, ``aws``,
``huggingface-cli`` or a private package index reads its token from the
environment, and silently dropping it would break those workflows for every
user to defend against a relay that rewrites tool calls.
``DEEPCODE_BASH_FULL_ENV=1`` remains the explicit "give children everything"
override and wins over the opt-in.
