"""Agent memory — project instructions + persistent cross-session notes (P2).

Two layers, aligned with Claude Code (DEEPCODE_V2_MASTER_PLAN.md P2-L5d(c)):

1. **Project instructions** — ``AGENTS.md`` / ``DEEPCODE.md`` / ``CLAUDE.md``
   discovered from the enclosing repo root down to the workspace (so a nested
   subdirectory inherits the project's root instructions), plus a user-global
   file (``~/.deepcode/AGENTS.md`` or ``~/.claude/CLAUDE.md``). Injected verbatim
   into the system prompt as standing guidance the agent should always honor.

2. **Persistent memory** — ``<workspace>/.deepcode/memory/``, which the agent
   reads and writes through the :class:`MemoryTool`. ``MEMORY.md`` is the
   index and is auto-loaded into the system prompt on every session, so
   durable facts (decisions, conventions, gotchas) survive across
   conversations.

Persistent memory itself has three layers (P2-2, following Claude Code's
memory layout):

1. the ``MEMORY.md`` **index**, permanently in context, holding *pointers* —
   one ``- [Title](topic.md) — hook`` line per topic, which is why it is
   capped at :data:`_MAX_INDEX_LINES` lines / :data:`_MAX_INDEX_BYTES` bytes;
2. the **topic files** under the same directory that hold the facts, read on
   demand via :func:`fetch_memory_topic`;
3. the offline **consolidation pass** (:func:`consolidate_memory_index`) —
   Orient → Gather → Consolidate → Prune — which returns a candidate index and
   writes nothing.

Both are assembled once, in :func:`core.agent_setup.build_agent_session`, so
every frontend — TUI, web, headless exec — gets memory identically. The
memory directory lives inside the workspace, so the P1 permission engine
already fences writes to it; the tool additionally refuses any name that
escapes the memory directory.

# Orient → Gather → Consolidate → Prune, as functions over plain values (only
# ``orient`` touches the filesystem), so every phase is unit-testable and the
# whole pass is reproducible.
#
# Two invariants matter more than the merge heuristic:
#
# * **Deterministic.** The same directory yields byte-identical output, because
#   the pass rewrites a user's memory: an unstable ordering (a set, a
#   timestamp, raw directory-iteration order) would produce a different file
#   every night and an unattributable diff when something finally goes wrong.
#   Topic files are therefore visited in sorted-name order and no timestamp is
#   ever written into the merged body.
# * **Non-destructive.** ``consolidate_memory_index`` returns text and writes
#   nothing. It runs unattended — nobody reads the result before it lands — so
#   the only safe contract is "here is a candidate file": the caller decides
#   where it goes (:data:`_CONSOLIDATED_INDEX_FILE` is the suggested new path)
#   and ``MEMORY.md`` is never emptied or rewritten in place.
#
# The caps are the reason the index can be injected on every turn: it is the
# only part of memory that is always in context, so it is bounded by
# construction. Bytes are counted in UTF-8, because a Chinese memory line costs
# ~3 bytes per character and a character count would under-report the prompt
# cost several-fold.
