"""Structured sub-agent results via a forced capture tool.

Borrowed from dsh's in-process subagent providers, which implement the
``outputSchema`` capability "with a forced capture tool": the child gets one
extra tool whose parameters ARE the requested object-rooted JSON Schema, and
the delegation result is the arguments of its last accepted call — not prose
scraped out of a final message.

Validation is free: the tool registry's ``prepare_call`` already runs
``Tool.validate_params`` against a tool's declared parameters, so a
non-conforming submission comes back to the child as an ordinary
errors-as-data result it can correct and retry.
