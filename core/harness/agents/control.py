"""AgentControl — the coordination state for model-driven delegation (C2).

Faithful to the reference agent's multi-agent design, adapted to DeepCode:

- **spawn is non-blocking** — it starts a sub-agent as a background task and
  returns its id immediately; several run *concurrently*, bounded by a per-session
  limit (``max_threads``);
- **results flow through the active Turn inbox** — application-backed sessions
  use the same atomic input boundary as user steering; direct CLI sessions use
  a local compatibility mailbox owned by that Agent runtime;
- **wait_agent parks on mailbox activity** (:meth:`wait_for_activity`) rather
  than joining a future — so the parent can keep working and collect results as
  they arrive.

Isolation is DeepCode's own guarantee: each sub-agent may run in its own git
worktree whose result is merged back with 3-way-merge conflict detection; base
git ops are serialised (``_git_lock``) while the sub-agents build in parallel.

Depth is capped at one: a sub-agent session is built with ``allow_spawn=False``
so it gets no delegation tools and cannot recurse.
